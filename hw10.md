# Write out the list after the 2nd pass. 
1st : 8, 33, 56, 17, 22, 95    
2nd : 8, 17, 33, 56, 22, 95  

# Give a sorted array as list={60,65,75,80,90,95}. 
Design an algorithm to insert the value of x into the sorted array. Then test the algorithm with value 50,67,99. 
思考：为什么选择插入点在list头上、中间、尾巴上的三个数作为算 法测试的数据，你能解释吗？
